# Persona Statement
As a Java instructor, I want to evaluate your basic understanding of Java.  This repository provides a simple Java program that WILL NOT COMPILE!  You need to evaluate the Java program and determine why it will not compile and to optimize it somewhat.

# Acceptance Criteria
Below are the items that represent the acceptance criteria for this task.  In order to achieve a perfect score on this assignment you must submit work that satisfies all the ACs listed below.

- The Java program must be created and ran from a class called HelloWorld.
- The program must output two strings on different lines.
  - The first line of the output should say **Hello World!**
  - The second line of the output should say **I am looking forward to learning about Java!**
- The starter code implements a single print function containing the newline character '\n'. You must modify the implementation to use standard Java built-in functions that create new lines automatically.  

# GitHub Web-Hook Tests
The following tests will be ran, as Github web-hooks, when new code is pushed to this repository. Some of the tests below may not be in individual tests.  The tests may only provide general feedback and may not provide insight on which specific tests have failed.  This assignment is very basic and it is important that you research problems before reaching out for help.  

- A test to check whether the program will compile.
- The class is appropriately implemented with the name HelloWorld.
- The program contains two distinct output statements that automatically create new line characters.
- The program prints out the appopriate output (two distinct phrases in the ACs on different lines without using '\n').

# Slack Channel **Java-Prog-Assignment-1**

A slack channel named **java-program-assignment-1** has been created for students to collaborate on this assignment.  No one is allowed to engage in acadmic dishonesty. Everyone should submit their own work.  However, students are able to provide general advice and guideance.  The instructor will monitor the communication and may provide hints.
